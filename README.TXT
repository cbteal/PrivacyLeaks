PROJECT TITLE: Privacy Leak Practice
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Implement methods to prevent privacy leaks
VERSION or DATE: January 2017
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run main in the Driver file
AUTHORS: Connor Teal â€” Skeleton by Rob Nash
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Run main in the driver file. Tests should all pass.

NOTES: This program was meant to work on implementing classes in a way that we protect class information from privacy leaks. By making copies of objects we avoid passing by reference and allowing access to what should be a private memory location.
